Challenge 3.0 - HTML5, CSS, Javascript

Take what you made for Week 2 and implement the following features for desktop:

1. Basic calendar showing one month.
2. Display events based on generated data. (See Week 2 for sample data)
3. Change the month and year.
4. Add/Remove events.

I recommend using Moment.js for parsing and displaying dates, as well as jQuery for DOM manipulation. If you would like more sample data, check out GenerateData.com. Be sure your data has a host, location, date, and description.
