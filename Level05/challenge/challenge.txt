Challenge 5.0 - HTML, JS, CSS
This is a two-part challenge, once you complete the first part I will send you the second (you'll see why).
 
Part 1 - Tab Layout:

1. It must handle at least 4-7 tabs (more if you want).
2. It must work in every browser (IE7+).
3. It must be a jQuery plugin,

The image below is just one example of how your tabs may look. Feel free to try something crazy when it comes to the tabs, give it some style.

I suggest you start by creating the layout and basic logic to make it work using vanilla.js (you CANNOT use a pre-existing tab plugin). Then convert that into a jQuery plugin (jQuery has basic and advanced tutorials, but you should only need the basic one).

Creating custom jQuery plugins can make a huge impact in your large scale projects. From submitting forms via AJAX to handling common style/animation tweaks, it's definitely a great tool to have.

Once you complete this challenge, send it to me and I will send you the next part. It is related, so make sure you have it handy when starting part two.

Good luck!
